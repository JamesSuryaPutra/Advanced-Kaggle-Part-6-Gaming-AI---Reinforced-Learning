<Introduction>
You have seen how to define a random agent. In this exercise, you'll make a few improvements. To get started, run the code cell below to set up our feedback system.

<1st step: A smarter agent>
We can improve the performance without devising a complicated strategy, simply by selecting a winning move, if one is available. In this exercise, you'll create an agent that:
1} Selects the winning move, if it is available (if there is more than one move that lets the agent win the game, the agent can select any of them).
2} Otherwise, it should select a random move.

To help you with this goal, we provide some helper functions in the code cell below.

****************
import numpy as np
â€‹
# Gets board at next step if agent drops piece in selected column
def drop_piece(grid, col, piece, config):
    next_grid = grid.copy()
    for row in range(config.rows-1, -1, -1):
        if next_grid[row][col] == 0:
            break
    next_grid[row][col] = piece
    return next_grid

# Returns True if dropping piece in column results in game win
def check_winning_move(obs, config, col, piece):
    # Convert the board to a 2D grid
    grid = np.asarray(obs.board).reshape(config.rows, config.columns)
    next_grid = drop_piece(grid, col, piece, config)
    # horizontal
    for row in range(config.rows):
        for col in range(config.columns-(config.inarow-1)):
            window = list(next_grid[row,col:col+config.inarow])
            if window.count(piece) == config.inarow:
                return True
    # vertical
    for row in range(config.rows-(config.inarow-1)):
        for col in range(config.columns):
            window = list(next_grid[row:row+config.inarow,col])
            if window.count(piece) == config.inarow:
                return True
    # positive diagonal
    for row in range(config.rows-(config.inarow-1)):
        for col in range(config.columns-(config.inarow-1)):
            window = list(next_grid[range(row, row+config.inarow), range(col, col+config.inarow)])
            if window.count(piece) == config.inarow:
                return True
    # negative diagonal
    for row in range(config.inarow-1, config.rows):
        for col in range(config.columns-(config.inarow-1)):
            window = list(next_grid[range(row, row-config.inarow, -1), range(col, col+config.inarow)])
            if window.count(piece) == config.inarow:
                return True
    return False
****************

The check_winning_move() function takes four required arguments: the first two (obs and config) should be familiar, and:
1} col is any valid move.
2} piece is either the agent's mark or the mark of its opponent.

The function returns True if dropping the piece in the provided column wins the game (for either the agent or its opponent), and otherwise returns False. To check if the agent can win in
the next move, you should set piece=obs.mark.

To complete this exercise, you need to define agent_q1() in the code cell below. To do this, you're encouraged to use the check_winning_move() function. The drop_piece() function (defin
ed in the code cell above) is called in the check_winning_move() function. Feel free to examine the details, but you won't need a detailed understanding to solve the exercise.

****************
import random

def agent_q1(obs, config):
    valid_moves = [col for col in range(config.columns) if obs.board[col] == 0]
    # Your code here: Amend the agent!
    for col in valid_moves:
        if check_winning_move(obs, config, col, obs.mark):
            return col
    return random.choice(valid_moves)
    
# Check your answer
q_1.check()

Correct

# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
q_1.hint()
q_1.solution()

Hint:
Use the check_winning_move() function, and set piece=obs.mark. You can check if the agent can win the game by dropping its piece in a specific column by supplying the column as the col
argument to the function.

Solution:
def agent_q1(obs, config):
    valid_moves = [col for col in range(config.columns) if obs.board[col] == 0]
    for col in valid_moves:
        if check_winning_move(obs, config, col, obs.mark):
            return col
    return random.choice(valid_moves)
****************

<2nd step: An even smarter agent>
In the previous question, you created an agent that selects winning moves. In this problem, you'll amend the code to create an agent that can also block its opponent from winning. In
particular, your agent should:
1} Select a winning move, if one is available.
2} Otherwise, it selects a move to block the opponent from winning, if the opponent has a move that it can play in its next turn to win the game.
3} If neither the agent nor the opponent can win in their next moves, the agent selects a random move.

To help you with this exercise, you are encouraged to start with the agent from the previous exercise. To check if the opponent has a winning move, you can use the check_winning_move()
function, but you'll need to supply a different value for the piece argument.

****************
def agent_q2(obs, config):
    valid_moves = [col for col in range(config.columns) if obs.board[col] == 0]
    # Your code here: Amend the agent!
    for col in valid_moves:
        if check_winning_move(obs, config, col, obs.mark):
            return col
    for col in valid_moves:
        if check_winning_move(obs, config, col, obs.mark%2+1):
            return col
    return random.choice(valid_moves)

# Check your answer
q_2.check()

Correct

# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
q_2.hint()
q_2.solution()

Hint:
Start with the code from the agent you created above. To check if the opponent can win in its next move, use the same check_winning_move() function, and set piece=obs.mark%2+1.

Solution:
def agent_q2(obs, config):
    valid_moves = [col for col in range(config.columns) if obs.board[col] == 0]
    for col in valid_moves:
        if check_winning_move(obs, config, col, obs.mark):
            return col
    for col in valid_moves:
        if check_winning_move(obs, config, col, obs.mark%2+1):
            return col
    return random.choice(valid_moves)
****************

<3rd step: Looking ahead>
So far, you have encoded an agent that always selects the winning move, if it's available. And, it can also block the opponent from winning. You might expect that this agent should per
form quite well! But how is it still possible that it can still lose the game?

****************
q_3.hint()

Hint:
Consider this board:
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 2 2 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 0 0

or this board:
2 1 2 2 2 0 2
1 2 1 1 1 0 1
2 1 2 2 2 0 2
1 2 1 1 1 0 1
2 1 2 2 2 0 2
1 2 1 1 2 0 1

# Check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)
q_3.solution()

Solution:
The agent can still lose the game, if the opponent has set up the board so that it can win in the next move by dropping a disc in any of 2 or more columns, or the only move that is avail
able to the agent is one where, once played, the opponent can win in the next move.
****************

<4th step: Create your own agent>
Amend the my_agent() function below to create your own agent. Feel free to copy an agent that you created above. Note that you'll have to include all of the necessary imports and helper
functions. For an example of how this would look with the first agent you created in the exercise, take a look at this notebook.

****************
import random

def my_agent(obs, config):
    valid_moves = [col for col in range(config.columns) if obs.board[col] == 0]
    # Your code here: Amend the agent!
    for col in valid_moves:
        if check_winning_move(obs, config, col, obs.mark):
            return col
    return random.choice(valid_moves)

# Run this code cell to get credit for creating an agent
q_4.check()

Thank you for creating an agent!
****************

Run the next code cell to watch the agent play a game against the random agent. You can re-run the code cell to play again!

****************
from kaggle_environments import evaluate, make

env = make("connectx", debug=True)
env.run([my_agent, "random"])
env.render(mode="ipython")
****************

<5th step: Submit to the competition>
Now, it's time to make your first submission to the competition! Run the next code cell to write your agent to a submission file.

****************
import inspect
import os

def write_agent_to_file(function, file):
    with open(file, "a" if os.path.exists(file) else "w") as f:
        f.write(inspect.getsource(function))
        print(function, "written to", file)

write_agent_to_file(my_agent, "submission.py")

# Check that submission file was created
q_5.check()

<function my_agent at 0x7c9021469480> written to submission.py

Thank you for creating a submission file!
